                <p>Welcome to Draggin' Weights! We are so happy to see you are interested in becoming the best you
                    possible!
                    We offer a wide variety of resources
                    from free weights and weightlifting, to weekly competetions every Friday night. We also boast a
                    vending
                    machine of healthy snacks and rejuvenating drinks.

                <p1>Why are we called Draggin' Weights? Well, our founder, Jules, is a cross dresser who wants to keep
                    in
                    the best shape they can. As a drag queen, they have gone through
                    some rough times, people disparraging against them. Draggin' Weights is a way for them to flaunt all
                    they've got and continue to spread the love of working out to others in
                    the communiy. This gym is their heart and soul, and has even captured the eyes of Andrea Rhodea,
                    re-knowned owner of the HoneyBee Inn. As Andrea says often, "Beauty isn't
                    limited to a gender", and in that spirit, Draggin' Weights is open to ALL: man, woman or anything
                    else!
                </p1>
            </div>
            <div class="competitions">
                <p class="2">You'll notice a lot of gyms make a point to have a 'non-competition' environment. That is
                    not
                    the case here. This is a place designed to push you to your limits
                    to achieve the highest heights. How can you get there if you never work with anyone? Or against
                    anyone?
                    For that reason, EVERY Friday night, at 6 pm local, we off a Friendly
                    competition. We do squats, pull ups and push ups. Walk ins are always welcome! What is the reward?
                    The
                    crying of muscles that have been worked to the bone! If you aren't sore
                    tomorrow, you haven't worked hard enough; that's our philosphy!

                <p2>Jules is our daytime trainer. He has been training folks for years and loves to pass on his
                    knowledge
                    and dedication to every new soul that wanders in.
                    He works closely with Andrea Rhodea and has been the lifeblood behind the competetions we hold for
                    years. If you feel up to it, challenge him!

                <p2>Sephiroth is our combat trainer. He will make life miserable for you for a long while, but you'll
                    realize that it's all for a reason and you'll come back
                    stronger each time. He mostly works in the evenings, but if you ask, he usually will make time for a
                    quick battle during the day. Please schedule an
                    appointment first!
